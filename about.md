Hi!

My name is Max Scheijen. I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Political Science from the University of Amsterdam with a minor in International Relations and Privacy. I currently study Data Science and Society at Tilburg University.

In the last year of my bachelor's, I developed a very strong interest in statistics, data science, and machine learning. By doing my masters in Data Science I was able to connect both my interests in political science and data science.

On this personal blog, I share projects, articles, and essays regarding data science, statistics, machine learning, and data in politics and many more topics. I try to keep this blog a minimal as possible, the conent is the only thing that matters.

Thanks for visiting my blog!
