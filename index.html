            Why you should be using of Scikit-learn Pipelines
          </a>
        </h3><p>In my opinion, pipelines in scikit-learn are one of the most useful things in the library. They allow you to sequentially apply a list of transformers and a final estimator to your data. Furthermore, they can be used in cross-validation. This ensures that data transformations within the cross-validation loop are only fitted on the training data. This prevents data leakage and better generalization on the test dataset or in production. Pipelines can also be used in a  grid or random search for the best hyperparameters. However, this is not limited to model parameters. We can also search for the best data transformations hyper-parameters (imputation with the median or the mean) in conjunction with the model hyper-parameters.</p>

        </h3><p>I have been wearing a Fitbit Charge 3 activity tracker for a little more than a year now. This fitness tracker does more than simply track steps. Because of its additional sensors, it can track more movements and physical attributes. For example, it also tracks distance, keeps track of your heart rate, the calories you burn during the day, and tracks your sleep.</p>

We have a great performing model, but what to do now? We can make interacting with our trained model more enjoyable. Therefore, today we are going to build a really simple web app to deploy a trained deep learning image classifier. This application allows the user to submit their own image and get a classification label back.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>In this post, I would like to demonstrate a quick way to create a good performing machine learning model. It is often encouraging to get a good performing model fast, without major pre-processing and featuring engineering. After this, we can use model selection, hyper-parameter tweaking, and feature engineering to squeeze out a little more predictive performance. However, it is really encouraging to get a well-performing fast.</p>

            Robust Cross Validation for Data Science - Taxi Trip Duration
          </a>
        </h3><p>One of the first things you learn when applying machine learning models is the notion of cross-validation. Training a model, which basically is learning the parameters of a prediction function, and evaluating the performance of a model on the same dataset is a methodological mistake. The machine learning model could learn the labels of the data and reproduce them. However, this is not really what we want. If we then deploy the machine learning model on unseen data, we run the risk of predicting not anything useful. Our model has only learned the training data.</p>

            Feature Engineering: Categorical Data
          </a>
        </h3><p>Good and robust feature engineering can improve many machine learning models. One way to create new features is by encoding categorical variables. Categorical features contain qualitative information. Many machine learning algorithms can only deal with numerical data. However, these categorical variables are often encoded as strings. There are many techniques to encode these features. In this post, we look at several basic methods of transforming these variables to some numeric representation. I highlight the pros and cons of these encoding techniques for the use of some of the commonly used machine learning models.</p>
