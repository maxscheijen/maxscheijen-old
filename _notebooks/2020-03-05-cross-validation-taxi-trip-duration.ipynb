    "One of the first things you learn when applying machine learning models is the notion of cross-validation. Training a model, which basically is learning the parameters of a prediction function, and evaluating the performance of a model on the same dataset is a methodological mistake. The machine learning model could learn the labels of the data and reproduce them. However, this is not really what we want. If we then deploy the machine learning model on unseen data, we run the risk of predicting not anything useful. Our model has only learned the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I present a robust cross-validation method for tabular data. This method, among other things, can be used in Data Science competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this technique, we use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/overview\" target=\"_blank\">New York City Taxi Trip Duration</a> competition hosted on <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kaggle</a>. In this competition, we try to predict the trip duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is not intended to achieve a high score in the competition in question. I  demonstrate a way to implement a cross-validation method that gives the same results on validation data as on unseen test data.\n",

    "__NOTE__: This methods is heavily based on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/abhi1thakur\" target=\"_blank\">Abhishek Thakur</a> cross validation method."

We then train our algorithm on 4 groups of the data, and we validate the model on the 1 group of data that the model has not yet seen.
