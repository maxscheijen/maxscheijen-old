    "Good and robust feature engineering can improve many machine learning models. One way to create new features is by encoding categorical variables. Categorical features contain qualitative information. Many machine learning algorithms can only deal with numerical data. However, these categorical variables are often encoded as strings. There are many techniques to encode these features. In this post, we look at several basic methods of transforming these variables to some numeric representation. I highlight the pros and cons of these encoding techniques for the use of some of the commonly used machine learning models. \n",

    "## Categorical Data types\n",
    "There are two main types of categorical data. Nominal data has <u>no intrinsic order</u> to it. Examples of these features are the cities, street names, gender, and many more. Ordinal features are different because there is an <u>intrinsic order</u> to the categories. Often surveys use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale\" target=\"_black\">Likert scale</a> to get opinions about subjects. This scale as an order to it and ranges from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The data type of the variable influence the technique we use to encoding that particular feature. "

    "## One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "One-hot encoding or dummy encoding is a technique where we encode a categorical by indicating if the category is present for each observation.  This technique is most used on nominal categorical data. Generally, we can encode the different labels by $k$-1 binary features. Where $k$ is the number of categories present in the variable. For example, the variable biological sex has two different variables (female and male) and therefore has a $k$ value of 2."
