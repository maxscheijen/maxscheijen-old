This is my first blog post. Let me introduce myself my name is Max. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Data Science at Tilburg University. I have a Bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of Amsterdam. My interest in all things related to data has been steadily growing over the years.

The articles on this blog will mainly focus on topics relating to Data Science. I'll post about my Data Science projects, notebooks, visualizations and all other insights and struggles along the way.

I hope you'll enjoy my blog!

Max
